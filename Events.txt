Events
======

Various events: Gifting. I don't know how that works because nobody's gifted me one!

There are four verbs that matter:
Examine: only ever the cyrodiil noticeboards.
Search: only ever corpses. You can't assume corpsename, since "Consolidate Loot" means they could loot a rat and get a boss' loot.
Talk: only ever specific people, though the list can be longish. Some people are event-specific, others exist year-round.
Use: only ever jubilee cakes.

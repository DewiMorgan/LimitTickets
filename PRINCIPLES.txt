Helpful coding notes and Addon dev principles
=============================================

Tips
----
IMPORTANT: Ignore updates to your addon in Minion!
d() is debug command in yellow text.
d(dump(SOME_TABLE)) is a method I stole from the interwebs to dump data.
CHAT_SYSTEM:AddMessage(<message String>) is for prettier stuff. I've wrapped this with tt() and dd(), below.


Principles
----------
* Have I18N
* Declare all dependencies
* Use ZOS constants wherever possible
* Avoid LibStub
* Avoid embedding shared libs
* Either use LibAddonMenu or at least put settings under Settings/Addons
* Avoid compulsory bound keys
* Avoid creating gobals
* Don't overwrite globals, especially constants! (or global styles!)
* Gamepad mode compatibility?
* Graceful crash-handling?
* Take care hooking (see below).
* Ensure replaced API fns will still work if ZOS adds more params/return values in the future. So use (...) as the params.
* Use ZO_ hooking fns where possible: https://github.com/esoui/esoui/blob/a34599f2cba93196976512d71f3b850cc9975ed9/esoui/libraries/utility/zo_hook.lua
* All hooks should fail gracefully! Not break anything if they fail.
* Don't depend on libs that change the UI, eg libslashcommander 
* For performance, avoid LUA's string concatenation, instead using string.format("%s %s", string1, string2), ZO_GenerateCommaSeparatedList(), or table.concat.
* Use OOP https://www.lua.org/pil/16.html

Hooking gotchas

  use hooks on the class def if possible, or on the object when you do not have access to the class def

  you have to be careful how you do that, since the class works with metatables. When you simply set
  the original function on the table, you'll actually prevent hooks on the class itself from working.
  [...] Don't undo your hooks.

That is:
Say you have `obj`, which inherits a `obj:fn` from it parent class definition through the `obj.__index` metatable. (this is how OOP works in Lua).
Then if you do `obj:fn = ...`, then `obj` will no longer inherit `fn`, but rather will use its own member function that you gave it.
So anything that hooks that parent's method after your hook, won't be able to affect `obj`.

Anything that hooks a method after you did, but before you removed it, will have hooked your
instance of the method. So if you saved a copy of the original, unhooked method and stick it back
there, you will remove all those later hooks, not just your own.
